      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

      <h3>1. Summarize the distinction(s) from the traditional Klines & Clines
        definition of the cyborg vs. the one that Clark is proposing as the
        main thesis of his book?
      </h3>
      <p>- What Clark is proposing is that a human being does not need to have machine feature to become a cyborg. Instead a machine could be an extension of human which he considers as being a machine the extension. For example smartphones can be a
        machine extension because it is responsive to the need we ask of it just like a cyborg. As for Clyne and Klines their definition is the literal sense of machine and human merging with each other to become one. Clark is more focused on how
        technology can help humans and as for Clyne and Klines they are more interested in the physical attribute of the cyborg connections.</p>

      <h3>2. From The book, "Cyberneticists were especially interested in
        self-regulating systems." What are 2 or more example of these,
        make sure to include both biological systems and also
        non-biological systems.
      </h3>

      <p>- A biological example could be found in a human system by how the body self regulates itself with making a certain impulse in a certain situation. A non-biological system could be found in computer where it uses software updated to regulate
        itself.
      </p>

      <h3>3. What other kind of definitions of a hybrid humans are there that
        are not based on definations above but popular in literture, media
        culture, etc.
      </h3>

      <p>- An elf could be considered a hybrid human because they have the features of a human and act like a human. But they are better known for living for a long time and being able to experience more thing in life. Also, they do not age as quicky
        as a human, so they get to look young for a long time.
      </p>


      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

      <h3>1. Summarize a definition as described in the book of what the
        significant attributes are for 'opaque' technology vs. 'transparent'
        technology.

      </h3>
      <p>- When we talk about opaque technology it is something we are thinking about a lot, on how we are going to use it or it is always in the back of our minds somehow. As for transparent technology it is something, we do not think about a lot
        this could be something that is just second nature to use and we can use it without thinking about it.</p>

      <h3>2. Give some examples of technology that might be better served if
        it were more transparent and and also give some example of a
        technology that should be more opaque.

      </h3>

      <p>- A biological example could be found in a human system by how the body self regulates itself with making a certain impulse in a certain situation. A non-biological system could be found in computer where it uses software updated to regulate
        itself.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Does the watch and dictionary example discussed in the book,
        seem valid to you? Why?
      </h3>

      <p>- I think a security camera should be more opaque technology because since it is something that is for security feature, we should know every feature that we can possibly use that we could use it to the full potential. As for transparent
        technology I would say apps because we could just use the internet to look up what a certain app can do.
      </p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

      <h3>1. Explain your experiences where your senses have momentarily
        misled you or someone you know. Give examples of this.


      </h3>
      <p>- When I would go into work at three in the morning in my previous job, I would always get this sense as if someone were calling my name. I knew there was no one there because not many people would be working around that area but since I was
        alone, I would think someone was calling my name but in reality, it was just the wind making noise because a door that leads outside the store was open.</p>

      <h3>2. What does 'The Early Adopters Dream Technology' example on
        page 80 and the mangrove analogy starting on page 81 say about
        the role of language and its relationship to thought and meaning?
        Do you agree with the Authors assertion?

      </h3>

      <p>- I do agree with the author because language is what gives our thoughts expression. Without language we would not be able to do anything that could improve our society, without words we wouldn’t be able to move forward because we wouldn’t
        be able to communicate our thoughts.
      </p>

      <h3>3. The Ideas of 'meta-learning' (page 67) and of constructive
        learning (page 83) are brought up in this chapter. What do these 2
        ideas have in common in terms of the process of learning and using
        information and memory? Please elaborate your thoughts on how
        you can 'learn' something from this.

      </h3>

      <p>- Both meta and constructive learning are different ways of learning, but both could be used to learn something. What I mean is everyone learns differently but each person can use both learning to mend them together and make it there own way
        of learning by using both.
      </p>

      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

      <h3>1. What are the 2 main components of action that is required for
        Telepresence to exist and function properly?
      </h3>
      <p>- Clark’s says there are two components to feel telepresence so that we can exist and function properly. Those two components are to be able to fully interact with surrounding environment and to actively be apart of the environment not just passing by be part of it.</p>

      <h3>2. What form of Telepresence do you think you have experienced?
        If you have not. What was closed to it, and what was missing for it to
        not be telepresence?

      </h3>

      <p>- I think the closest form of telepresence I have experienced is when I have used a VR headset. With this type of device, I have felt like I was taken into another place because not only has my face ben covered but also my years, so it does not feel like I am in the same room. I think if I did not have earphones on it would have taken the telepresence away because I would have been able to hear the outside noise.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Speculate on what other mechanics and sensory modalities that
        are based on Telepresence ideas, might be possible. In what other
        ways can we be 'displaced' in their perception of where they are and
        what they can do?


      </h3>

      <p>- I think new innovation of video editing with how good people are getting, it sometimes feel like I am actually in the video because of how well they incorporate the viewer in the video. As newer technology arrives there will be more techniques to make the viewer like thery are acutlly in the video.
